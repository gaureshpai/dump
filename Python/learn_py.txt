direct op = +, -, *, /, %, +=, -=, *=, /=

strings can be concatenated without +

strings can be multipled using *

varname = value

# comment

print("hello world",variable)

input() # get input from user

len() to get the length of the string

str() to convert to string

int() to convert to integer from float

type() to get the type of the variable

float() to convert to float

integer == float

in operations "is" and "is not" is is used and not == or !=

to use multiple comparisions use "and", "or", "not"

if value == value: # if value is equal to value
  do something # body of the if

indent is very important

else if = "elif"

"break;" will break out of the loop

"continue;" will continue the loop

indentation will show the block of code
