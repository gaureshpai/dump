To solve the Coin Collection Problem using dynamic programming:
Define the DP State:
    Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum number of coins that can be collected up to cell (i, j).
Formulate the Recurrence Relation:
    To compute dp[i][j], consider:
    If coming from the left, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + G[i][j].
    If coming from above, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + G[i][j].
    Therefore, dp[i][j] = G[i][j] + max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).
Initialize the DP Table:
    Set dp[0][0] = G[0][0] (starting point).
    Initialize the first row: dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + G[0][j] for all j.
    Initialize the first column: dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + G[i][0] for all i.
Fill the DP Table:
    For each i from 1 to m-1 and each j from 1 to n-1, update dp[i][j] using the recurrence relation.
Return the Result:
    Return dp[m-1][n-1], which represents the maximum number of coins collected to reach the bottom-right corner.

Algorithm CoinCollection(grid, m, n)
    Input: A 2D array grid of size m x n where grid[i][j] represents the number of coins in the cell at row i and column j
    Output: Maximum number of coins that can be collected from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid

    Let dp[0 ... m-1][0 ... n-1] be a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of coins that can be collected up to cell (i, j).
    Set dp[0][0] = grid[0][0].

    For each j from 1 to n-1, 
        set dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j].
    For each i from 1 to m-1, 
        set dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0].

    For each i from 1 to m-1:
        For each j from 1 to n-1:
            Set dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).

    Return dp[m-1][n-1].
