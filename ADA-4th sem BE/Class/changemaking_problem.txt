To solve the Change-Making Problem using dynamic programming:
Define the DP State:
    Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount i.
    Formulate the Recurrence Relation:
To compute dp[i], consider:
    For each coin c in coins, if i - c is non-negative, then dp[i] can be updated as dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1).
Initialize the DP Table:
    Set dp[0] = 0 (zero coins are needed to make amount 0).
    Set all other dp[i] values to a large number (e.g., amount + 1) to represent initially unreachable states.
Fill the DP Table:
    Iterate through amounts from 1 to amount, updating the dp table using the recurrence relation.
Return the Result:
    If dp[amount] is still set to the initial large value, return -1 (indicating that it's not possible to make the target amount). Otherwise, return dp[amount].

Algorithm ChangeMaking(coins[0 ... m-1], amount)
    Input: Array coins[0 ... m-1] representing the coin denominations, integer amount representing the target amount
    Output: Minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount, or -1 if it is not possible

    Initialization:

    Let dp[0 ... amount] be an array where dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount i.
    Set dp[0] = 0 (zero coins are needed to make amount 0).
    For all other i in 1 ... amount, set dp[i] = amount + 1 (initially assume the amount is unreachable).
    Fill DP Table:
        For each i from 1 to amount:
            For each coin c in coins[0 ... m-1]:
                If i - c >= 0:
                    Set dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1).
    Return Result:
        If dp[amount] > amount, return -1 (indicating that it is not possible to make the target amount).
        Otherwise, return dp[amount].
