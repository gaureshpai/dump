1 Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth, and find the number of packets dropped.

2 Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion. 

3 Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.

4 Develop a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).

5 Develop a program to implement a sliding window protocol in the data link layer. 

6 Develop a program to find the shortest path between vertices using the Bellman-Ford and path vector routing algorithm. 

7 Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.

8 Develop a program on a datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at the server side.

9 Develop a program for a simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data. 

10 Develop a program for congestion control using a leaky bucket algorithm.
