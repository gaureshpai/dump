What is javascript?
    javascript is a light-weight,cross-platform object oriented programming language.

what is a loop?
    the repetition of a code is called loop and each repetition is called an iteration,in other words, running the same lines of code for a certain number if times is called loop

what is scope?
    the scope defines the part of the Program where a variable or a function is visible/accessible


Basics:
    variables,datatypes,operators,expressions
    
Program flow:
    js executes the code from the top to bottom.It executes one line of code at a time. If an error occurs then the next line of code is not executed.

javascript variables:
    Recomended case type: Camel case 
    Rules for naming javascript variables:
        name can contain letters, digits _ and $
        name cannot start with a digit
        name can start with a _ or a $
        names are case sensitive
        names cannot be reserved keywords
    variable untill defined or assigned holds undefined value i.e it doesnt hold null value but holds undefined value

javascript operators:
    arithmatic: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
        Post increment/decrement value gets copied or executed and then gets incremented
        Pre increment/decrement value gets incremented and then gets copied or executed
    assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /= ,%=
    comparision: ==, !=, >, < , >=, <=
    logical: &&, ||, ?:(Ternary)

javascript datatype conversion(explicit):
    datatype() -> converts the argument passed inside the bracket to the asked datatype

javascript objects:
    enclosed in flower brackets 
    assigned as normal variables
    object can be defined insdie another object
    functions can be defined inside the object

javascript arrays:
    can be defined and assigned in many ways 
    similar to all the other languages like c, c++, java, python
    concat functions adds two arrays from consecutive locations at the end of the first array

javascript loops:
    While loop, for loop
    when you know how many times your loop needs to iterate then you can use for loop
    when you have the kind of loop where you need to stop the loop based on certain condition, you can use while loop

javascript functions:
    syntax: function functionName(param1,param2, ... ,paramN){
                        {block of code}
                     }

javascript scope:
    the variables defined outside all the functions and blocks are available throughout the code.These are called Global variables
    the variables defined insdie the functions or blocks are local variables and are only available in that function or block of code.These variables are called Local variables

javascript variable hoisting:
    the mechanism where variables and function can be used before declaring them is called hoisting in javascript
    Code execution in this case:
        the variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution
        javascript has two steps in executing a particular script.
            step-1:Creation
            step-2:Execution
    The hoisting effect makes the creation show up before execution while compiling/executing the code
    even functions can be declared later but used first using hoisting effect
    


javascript predefined functions:
    console.clear() -> clears the console/terminal
    console.log() -> prints the statement in the console/terminal
    typeof() -> returns the datatype of the parameter inside the bracket
    variable.toString() -> converts the variable of any datatype to toString
    parseInt() -> returns the integer value of the argument inside the bracket
    parseFloat() -> returns a floating number of the argument inside the bracket
    variable.toFixed() -> rounds it off to the nearest integer value 0 decimal places in default but you can pass arguments for number of decimal values too
    variable.length -> returns the length of the String
    variable.indexOf() -> returns the index value of the string passed as an argument(index start only not scope)
    variable.lastIndexOf() -> returns the start index from last position of the string of the string passed as an argument(index start only not scope)
    variable.slice(arg1,arg2) -> returns the slice of the string between position arg1 and arg2 from the main string,if only 1 arg sent then then the other selects the ends
    variable.substr(arg1, arg2) -> returns the substring between position arg1 and arg2 from the main string,if only 1 arg sent then then the other selects the ends
    variable.toUpperCase() -> returns the uppercase value of the argument passed
    variable.toLowerCase() -> returns the lowercase value of the argument passed
    variable.concat() -> concatinates the passed argument to the variable, also as many as arguments can be passed which will be concatinated in order seperated by commas or '+'
    variable.trim() -> returns the trimmed value i.e all the excess spaces like tab,spacebar are removed
    variable.charAt() -> returns the characted at the passed argument position
    variable.split() -> returns the split string on the basis of the arguments passed, default is spacebar
    variable.push() -> pushes or adds the argument passed to the variable top position
    variable.pop() -> returns and removes the last entered value from the variable array
    variable.splice() -> takes 4 arguments:1st tells where to start,2nd tells how many items to be deleted,3rd and 4th and so on tells what itsems to be added
    variable.sort() -> Sorts the variable array in ascending order
    variable.reverse() -> Sorts the variable array in descending order
