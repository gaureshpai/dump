/*
Question:
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
*/

class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) i++;
            j++;
        }

        return i == s.length();
    }
