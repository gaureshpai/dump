Question:
Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid. T
he rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:
- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
- The first player A always places 'X' characters, while the second player B always places 'O' characters.
- 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
- The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.
Given a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that the ith move will be played on grid[rowi][coli]. 
return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B). 
In case the game ends in a draw return "Draw". 
If there are still movements to play return "Pending".
You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and A will play first.
